<!--The box model: take div that has background color and height and width of 300px. If height is 600px it will expand vertically. You can do the same with the width and make it wider. You can also use percentage if 100% it will be a percentage of view point. It will expand with the screen size. In addition to the width and the height you can specify that it shoudl have a border The default is 3px adn does not encroach or effect size of box. A border with can be as large as it wants but wont affect the sqaure size. you can say border top 0 and only top will go to zero. Or you can use circle method of : 0px (top) 10px (right) 20x bottom and left 30px. You can add padding between text and where border starts- padding 20px is 20 px of space. Padding increases size of box.

Margin is buffer between an element say a box and another box.
use chrome developer tools to test your changes

CSS display property:

Block- take up the whole with of the screen.No other element can sit here. The common ones are paragraph, header, divisions, lists and items and forms

inline Spans <span>, Images <img> Anchors <a>. the dont block elements from being on the same line they encourage them. All span will be stacked in the same line. With inline elements you cant change the width.

You can change display of every element.


NBNBNBNB
if you put display: inline- it woll change the feature of the element and make the items in line with one another!

inline-block: The best of inline and a block. They go into the same line.
If you use display and set to none, the object will be removed like it does not exist.
visibility: hidden- it makes the element disspear and keeps it original position and all elements flow around it.
CSS positioning: CSS has rules before you even start.

Content is Everything!

The order of elements on screen come from html code.

If you change the order then the website will display in that way.

Children sit on top of parents. If you have div and then h1 I am a programmer the h1 bounces out if the screen.

<<div>
<h1> a <<span>pro</span>grammer</h1>
</div>
  The div is at the bottom, the, h1 is above it and the span is at the top
</div>

Position:

Static: All elements are static by default.

Relative: allow you to postion element that you select relative to how it would be positioned if it were static

Absolute: css code div{
positon: relative
}
img {
position: absolute
right:30px; as opposed to relative position a shift of 30px will shift things to the right instead of left.
}
absolute positioning does affect the flow of the html as opposed to the relative postioning which does not!The ghost element does not remain.
in absolute position it is no longer part of the document. red and blue dont exist to yellow. But you can move red anywhere relative to the body.

The parent does  not allows have to be the body it can be the body with the closest lay out.



Fixed

img{

position : relative; this is to move it from default the static position

left: 30px push 30 pixels to the left from where it was.

}

Coordintates: Top, Bottom, Left, Right. To move our element

img{top:20px} it will move down 20px, bottom means up 20px. We give a 20px margin from the top to where it used to be.

When you move an element of one item it doesnt not effect the elements of anything else. Everything stays the same.


none- get rids of the element.

.red {
height: 100px;
width:100px
background-color: red;
postion: relative - does not change unless it is instructed to
left: 20px; means move it 20px from where it was
}
